# Hi, I'm Gabriel 👋

Software Engineer focused on **Python, AI systems, and backend architecture**.

I design and build production-oriented machine learning pipelines, LLM-based systems, and scalable APIs. My work sits at the intersection of AI, data engineering, and backend development.

Currently based in Portugal 🇵🇹 — open to remote opportunities and relocation within Europe.
